The Test Events Logger
Introduction

Events received or sent during the execution of a test are stored in the test result by the test logger. All things that happen during the execution of a test are converted to a event as template message. These events enables to make a complete analysis of what happened.

Events can be handled only by the adapters. Each adapters contains a queue to store all events.
Do, watch and compare

The test framework of the solution is based on the following test construction:

    Do an action in your test
    Watch what happens until the end of a timeout
    During this interval, you can compare a model provided by the tester with all events received.

The template message

All events received from the SUT are converted to a template message. Below some explanations about the construction of a template message. A template message is constructed with one or more template layer. A templayer layer is constructed with one ore more key/value. The value can be also a template layer.

Flexible comparison with operators

Operators can be used to compare templates messages together with a flexible approach.
Name 	Description
Any 	Match anything
Contains 	Check if a string contains the characters provided
Endswith 	Check if a string ends with the characters provided
Startswith 	Check if a string starts with the characters provided
GreaterThan 	Check if an integer is greater than the value providede
LowerThan 	Check if an integer is lower than the value provided
RegEx 	Match a specific regular expression.
